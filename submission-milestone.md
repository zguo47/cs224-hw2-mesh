### Mesh Validator
My mesh validator checks if the provided mesh data structure is valid. I implemented the half-edge structure, 
I defined a halfedge to contain its twin halfedge, the next halfedge it's pointing to, the origin vertex,
and the face it's on. For each Vertex, its field contains its index, which should also be its index in the 
vector of all vertices; the halfedge it's pointing to (arbitrary one); and its position vector. For each face,
its field contains the (arbitrary) halfedge pointing to it, and the face as a vector. 
My validator contains 17 assert statements that check on the above logic. 
To start, I check that size of halfedges should be 3 times size of faces (since each face correspond to 3 halfedges).
Second, I make sure for all halfedges, vertices and faces, every field should not be a nullptr, since we 
assume we are working on a closed geometry, and no operations should cause non-manifold. 
Third, I check that each halfedge is twin with its twin, that is, they are twins to each other. Also, 
the origin of each halfedge's twin should be the origin of its next halfedge. 
Fourth, I check that starting any halfedge and traverse through "next", it should perform a closed loop.
Fifth, I make sure that starting from any vertex and traverse the halfedges, there is also a closed loop.
Last, I make sure that there exist no zero area faces, in other words, the vertices of each face should be
unique. 
The above features a total of 17 assert statements.
The below are the detailed implementation.
