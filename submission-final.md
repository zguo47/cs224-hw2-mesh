## Mesh (final submission)

Please fill this out and submit your work to Gradescope by the deadline.

### Output Comparison
Run the program with the specified `.ini` config file to compare your output against the reference images. The program should automatically save the output mesh to the `student_outputs/final` folder. Please take a screenshot of the output mesh and place the image in the table below. Do so by placing the screenshot `.png` in the `student_outputs/final` folder and inserting the path in the table.

- For instance, after running the program with the `subdivide_icosahedron_4.ini` config file, go to and open `student_outputs/final/subdivide_icosahedron_4.obj`. Take a screenshot of the mesh and place the screenshot in the first row of the first table in the column titled `Your Output`.
- The markdown for the row should look something like `| subdivide_icosahedron_4.ini |  ![](ground_truth_pngs/final/subdivide_icosahedron_4.png) | ![](student_outputs/final/subdivide_icosahedron_4.png) |`

If you are not using the Qt framework, you may also produce your outputs otherwise so long as the output images show up in the table. In this case, please also describe how your code can be run to reproduce your outputs.

> Qt Creator users: If your program can't find certain files or you aren't seeing your output images appear, make sure to:<br/>
> 1. Set your working directory to the project directory
> 2. Set the command-line argument in Qt Creator to `template_inis/final/<ini_file_name>.ini`

Note that your outputs do **not** need to exactly match the reference outputs. There are several factors that may result in minor differences, especially for certain methods like simplification where equal-cost edges may be handled differently.



Please do not attempt to duplicate the given reference images; we have tools to detect this.

| `.ini` File To Produce Output | Expected Output | Your Output |
| :---------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | 
| subdivide_icosahedron_4.ini |  ![](ground_truth_pngs/final/subdivide_icosahedron_4.png) | ![Place screenshot of student_outputs/final/subdivide_icosahedron_4.obj here]() |
| simplify_sphere_full.ini |  ![](ground_truth_pngs/final/simplify_sphere_full.png) | ![Place screenshot of student_outputs/final/simplify_sphere_full.obj here]() |
| simplify_cow.ini | ![](ground_truth_pngs/final/simplify_cow.png) | ![Place screenshot of student_outputs/final/simplify_cow.obj here]() |
